## Overview

![demo](/demo.gif)

It sucks when you're not able to prove you've done cool stuff since it's all proprietary. I decided to change with this, [Shoppingify](https://shoppingify.vercel.app/). It's a cool little shopping list app that lets you quickly create, edit and complete (or cancel) shopping lists. What else could you want? Well, we've got histories and statistics!

This was a lot of fun to make. Learned a lot about Prisma, which is super awesome. Got a little more comfortable with Tailwind, and got to use my beloved React framework, Next.js.

I think for next time, I'd focus less on building up the API layer and use something like [Hasura](https://hasura.io/).

### Built With
